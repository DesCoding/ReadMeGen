# ReadMeGen - my README Generator

As a developer, add your input into this comand-line application to create a professional README doc for your project.  The application will be invoked by using the following command:

```bash
node index.js
```

Because this application won’t be deployed, you’ll also need to provide a link to a walkthrough video that demonstrates its functionality. Revisit the Screencastify Tutorial in the prework as a refresher on how to record video from your computer. You’ll need to submit a link to the video _and_ add it to the README of your project.
